🗺️ QC-Live Map Evo for Arma 3
Overview

This script allows you to display in real time on a 3D object (whiteboard, laptop, screen, tactical map, etc.) the position and status of operators directly in-game.
It’s designed for missions involving HQ operations, recon units, undercover gameplay, or advanced medical management (ACE).

The system creates a dynamic display that automatically updates the map to show:

Positions and directions of BLUFOR/CIVILIAN units

Medical status (wounded/unconscious) (known bug with blood loss tracking)

Laser targets and designated marks

Medical information and precise coordinates

⚙️ How It Works

To be visible on the live map, players or AI units must have the cTab tablet (“ItemcTab”) in their inventory.
The script then generates a live map synchronized with the game world.
You can interact with the map via the scroll-wheel menu to move the camera, lock the view, or refresh the display.
Unit icons update dynamically every few seconds.

🎛️ Key Features

Displays in real time all BLUFOR and CIVILIAN units with:

Name and facing direction

Dynamic colors for status:

🔵 Blue → BLUFOR units
🟣 Purple → CIVILIAN / Undercover units
🔴 Red / Flashing Red → Wounded or Unconscious operators

Additional Indicators

Name and Direction — the player or unit name is displayed, followed by their azimuth in degrees within curly braces {}.

Example: John Doe {270°}

Laser Designator (Red Cross) — if a vehicle or unit has an active laser target, a red cross will appear over the target’s location, with the name of the operator displayed below it.

Example: red cross over the target + label OperatorName underneath.

Reload Map → reloads the map texture

Retry Map Creation → regenerates the map display
